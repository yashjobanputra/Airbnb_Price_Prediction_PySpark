A comparison of price prediction models using pyspark and MLlib that aids hosts to price their rental and guests to evaluate the offered price.

## **Overview**

Estimating the right pricing range for the property rentals on the Airbnb website is a key factor to attract the numerous tourists and travellers. With more hosts getting added to the airbnb network and more exquisite rental properties on the market, pricing the rentals has become a challenging task for every owner. There could be any number of factors that influence the price for a rental including the size of the property, its distance from the sightseeing places in that city, seasonal charges like Christmas or New year, the neighbourhood in which it is located, extra amenities provided by the owners like parking space, swimming pool etc. Our research project will aim to identify and extract the most likely features from the selected dataset to develop a predictive model that would predict the optimal price for a rental property in a dynamic way. The source of data for this project would be multiple csv files from the Airbnb website. The website consists of listings in different cities across the world and we would be choosing 3 csv files for our project. We would be doing an end to end exploratory data analysis to understand the data and the features, perform feature engineering and extract the necessary features to develop a high performance predictive model to determine the price and present a comparative study on different machine learning models on this dataset.

## **Hypothesis, Goals & Deliverables**

For this project, we would be sourcing data from the Airbnb website for multiple locations to build the prediction model. The overall size of the dataset is expected to be very large and this makes it a right choice for a Big data analytics project. We would be implementing the data pre-processing, feature engineering and model development using Apache Spark libraries and pyspark which is the python API for Spark, Spark SQL would be the base programming languages used to implement this. 

The end deliverable for this project would be a statistical model that would be built by analyzing over 0.3 GB of data collected from various sources. This goal would be to provide an understanding to the owners and tourists about those features that would be most important in determining the price and an optimal price that should be quoted for a property. We would present a comparative study of several regression models that would be developed by us for this dataset. In the process we would be performing end to end exploratory data analysis of the dataset, perform data cleaning and wrangling, data modelling and present the final study from a storytelling perspective using different visualizations.

## **Conclusion & Summary**

-->Importing and merging the data of specific city, cleaned the data and preprocessed
-->Performed Exploratory Data Analysis, and hypothesis testing to select the most relevant features
-->Regression models such as Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regression were implemented
-->Gradient Boosting algorithm has the lowest RMSE (1.2) with R squared (0.9)
-->Linear Regression has highest RMSE (10.46) with least R squared (0.7)
